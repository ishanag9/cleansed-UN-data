Applying Data Structures to Manipulate Cleansed UN Data

In this project I create an application that processes an UN dataset, and manipulates this dataset using a variety of different data structures. In addition, I explore how to implement each data structure using industry-standard Java practices, and gain experience manipulating real life data sets.
